# Human_Activity_Recognition

Human activity recognition (HAR) is a captivating field at the crossroads of technology and human behavior. It involves the utilization of data analysis and machine learning techniques to discern and interpret the various activities performed by individuals. By analyzing data streams from sensors, cameras, or other sources, HAR aims to decipher intricate patterns and movements, enabling applications ranging from healthcare monitoring and sports analysis to smart environments and assistive technologies. As we delve deeper into the world of HAR, we gain valuable insights into understanding, predicting, and enhancing human actions in diverse contexts.

This project deals with the classification of human activities into 6 predefined classes based on mobile sensor data: Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.
