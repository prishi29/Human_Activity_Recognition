# Human_Activity_Recognition (HAR)

Human activity recognition (HAR) is a captivating field at the crossroads of technology and human behavior. It involves the utilization of data analysis and machine learning techniques to discern and interpret the various activities performed by individuals. By analyzing data streams from sensors, cameras, or other sources, HAR aims to decipher intricate patterns and movements, enabling applications ranging from healthcare monitoring and sports analysis to smart environments and assistive technologies. As we delve deeper into the world of HAR, we gain valuable insights into understanding, predicting, and enhancing human actions in diverse contexts.

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to the classification of human activities into six predefined classes using mobile sensor data. The classes include Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying. Through the analysis of sensor data, we aim to accurately categorize and understand the physical activities individuals are engaged in.

## Dataset

To embark on this journey, we have made use of a comprehensive dataset that captures various sensor readings during different activities. The dataset can be accessed through the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bsfeW2TiBNPfqzFxFEJeuE6y48LBxLcn?usp=drive_link).
